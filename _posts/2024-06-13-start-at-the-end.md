**We are all about to die.** Some of us in several decades, some of us today or tomorrow. We all know it, and most of us steer well clear of dealing with it. 

I am starting this blog to do the very opposite.

The path to happiness, or at least a sense of real, proper, meaning in your life, is not about coming to terms with mortality, or just distracting, amusing, pleasuring [ourselves to death](https://archive.org/download/Various_PDFs/NeilPostman-AmusingOurselvesToDeath.pdf). Unless you can dupe yourself long enough, and the price for that is way too steep, it's about embracing and creating terms by which you must then live and die, at the same time. 

Let me repeat that, as this is metaphorically the punch line, and literally the life line to climb out of any hole or cave you might find yourself in.

**The meaning of life is to embrace and create the terms by which you must then live and die.**

If applied like a razor to our days and nights, we create the opportunity to embrace and create and embrace again the terms by which we live and die. 

I am starting this blog as an account of journey through life and into death, making meaning as an act of [Flusserian rebellion](https://wiki.flusser.club/doku.php?id=entropy) against entropy: The rainbow that Schopenhauer saw shining over the waterfall of humanity. 

So welcome to my public diary, where I will share my acts of rebellion and invite you to come along for the ride! 

But first, let me know: **What are the terms by which *you* choose to live and die?**
